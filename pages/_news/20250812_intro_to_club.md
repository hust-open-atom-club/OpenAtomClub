# Introduction to HUST OpenAtom Open Source Club

## Why We Started the Club

The HUST OpenAtom Open Source Club is an active community dedicated to promoting open-source culture and contributing outstanding open-source software. We believe deeply in the importance of open-source culture and in the power of a shared open-source mission to make us stronger and more influential. With this conviction, we devote substantial human and material resources to contributing to open-source operating-system communities, guiding faculty and students to participate in open-source activities, and making our own contributions to these communities.

- We follow the open-source spirit of **openness, sharing, collaboration, and contribution**. Guided by this philosophy, we advance open-source initiatives both within and beyond the university. By continuously upgrading members' skills and capabilities—through code development, testing, bug fixing, documentation writing, and more—we give back to the community. Our current focus areas include the general Linux kernel and domestic Linux distributions (such as openEuler, OpenAnolis, openKylin, and Deepin, etc) as well as IoT operating systems (like LiteOS, RT-Thread, AliOS Things, and TencentOS Tiny, etc). We are steadily expanding the scope of our contributions and increasing our impact and value.

- Our club is composed of like-minded teachers and students from diverse academic backgrounds who share a strong interest and enthusiasm for open-source culture. We maintain a spirit of mutual learning and collaboration, encouraging all members to share knowledge and experience to ensure the club's sustainable development. Within the club, members support one another, improve their skills, and, together, contribute more to the community.

- We regularly organize seminars and roundtable discussions to share research findings, solve problems, and strengthen mutual understanding and trust. We welcome all students interested in open-source culture and eager to contribute. Here, you'll access cutting-edge open-source technologies, connect with like-minded peers, and forge your own path in open source.

## Establishment and Inauguration

Daily operations are managed by four departments: **Publicity Department**, **Editorial Department**, **Technical Department**, and **General Office**. A brief introduction to each:

- **Publicity & Editorial Departments**: Responsible for promoting the club's activities and writing event posts.

- **Technical Department**: The core force, divided into seven SIGs (Special Interest Groups):

  - **HUST Mirror SIG**: Maintains documentation, develops features, and manages servers for the open-source mirror site, providing stable and user-friendly download services.
  - **RustSBI SIG**: Develops the RustSBI open-source bootloader for RISC-V platforms, delivering secure and high-performance firmware solutions.
  - **Dojo SIG**: The club's education team, maintaining an on-campus pwn (Pokémon) learning platform aimed at sparking students' interest in pwn. Their motto: "pwn is key in your life."
  - **Linux Kernel SIG**: Focuses on Linux kernel security and documentation contributions—learning kernel security, providing security support, and writing/maintaining related kernel documents.
  - **RT-Thread SIG**: Contributes to the open-source IoT community, provides Q&A and training guidance, and pays special attention to vulnerability detection and fixing to foster a healthy community and improve project security.
  - **HCTT SIG**: The club's translation team, translating Linux-related technical articles, news, and essays from leading international media.
  - **OpenHarmony SIG**: Dedicated to learning and advancing the OpenHarmony open-source OS through technical exchanges, project collaboration, and community events, jointly driving the open-source ecosystem and exploring technological frontiers.

- **General Office**: Composed of faculty members who guide daily activities and manage the club's finances.

### Signature Events

- **Open-Source Workshops**  
  Open-Source Workshops are on-site events where participants learn and submit contributions. Experienced project maintainers set tasks and provide guidance, so even newcomers without prior programming experience can complete them. Hardware required for tasks is provided on site; once a task is finished, invited maintainers review and merge Pull Requests on the spot. The club currently hosts long-running RustSBI Workshops, Fuzzing Theory & Tools Workshops, and HCTT Workshops.

- **Open-source OS Training Camps Series**  
  Jointly initiated with Tsinghua University, the 2024 Autumn-Winter Open-source OS Training Camps for the Wuhan area focuses on OS kernel development. To spark enthusiasm for Rust programming and OS knowledge, the club organized eight online info sessions synchronized with offline learning events.

- **WHLUG Offline Salon Series**  
  In collaboration with the Deepin community, the club has held multiple WHLUG offline salons, providing a platform to share Linux related technologies and open-source development ideas.

## Other Highlights
